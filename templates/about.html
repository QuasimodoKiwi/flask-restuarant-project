        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Wilson's Diner was conceived by co-owners Connor Hamilton and Wilson Woodson in 1962 after a thought from Wilson that "Out of all cities in America, Lancaster needs help with the variety in food."
            With his buddy Connor, the two set off to different culinary schools under different masters of the culinary arts, to make Wilson's dream a reality.
            Thought of as a standard diner, the folks of Lancaster came soon to realize that the diner had introduced
            to the people of Lancaster a wide-variety of dishes, ranging from Western-region dishes to dishes from different corners of the world.
